- The Client module models a user that posts sweets, follows and blocks other users, and views sweets of other users.
<br>
- The Server module maintains storing of messages (called sweets; SU version of tweets), sweet feeds, and follower connections among the users.

The server welcomes incoming client connections and listens on a predetermined port. One or more clients may be linked to the server simultaneously. Each client is aware of the server's IP address and listening port (which must be entered using the GUI). Clients use a corresponding port to connect to the server and then log in using their usernames.
